# Modern-Slavery-Ring-Central-

 Introduction
Modern Slavery Statement
RingCentral has a zero-tolerance approach to all types of modern slavery and human trafficking within our business and supply chains. We are committed to improving our practices to combat slavery and human trafficking. We are committed to acting ethically and with integrity in our business dealings and relationships, and to implementing and enforcing effective systems and controls to ensure modern slavery is not taking place in our own business or in any of our supply chains. We are also committed to ensuring there is transparency in our approach to modern slavery in our own business and throughout our supply chains, consistent with our disclosure obligations. We expect the same high standards from all our contractors, suppliers, and other business partners.
Organisation's structure
We are a leading provider of global enterprise cloud communications and collaboration solutions in the communications and technology sector. We are a part of the RingCentral group of companies (RingCentral), and our ultimate parent company is RingCentral, Inc, a company listed on the New York Stock Exchange which has its head office in Belmont, California, United States. RingCentral has over 1,800 employees worldwide and operates in over 190 countries.

Businesses worldwide rely on RingCentral to connect their workforces, build relationships with customers, share knowledge, and get work done—how they want, wherever they want.
Our supply chains
RingCentral expects its vendors/suppliers to share its commitment to uphold the highest standards of human rights. As such, RingCentral has implemented a RingCentral Vendor Code of Conduct applicable to all vendors/suppliers and their subsidiaries, affiliates and subcontractors conducting business with or on behalf of RingCentral. This is available at https://www.ringcentral.com/legal/vendor-code-of-conduct.html. RingCentral believes that all workers in its supply chain deserves a fair and ethical workplace and should not be subjected to harsh or inhumane treatment. As such all vendors have an obligation to conduct their
  
 employment practices in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and must ensure that all work is voluntary. Vendors in our supply chain have an obligation to not traffic persons or use any form of slave, forced, bonded, indentured or prison labour as well as to comply with all local and national minimum working age laws and not use child labour.
To ensure compliance with Modern Slavery laws, RingCentral incorporated an anti-slavery clause into its master services agreement with vendors. This clause requires suppliers and their employees to commit not to engage in slavery or human trafficking and to conduct due diligence of their own supply chain.
Our policies on slavery and human trafficking
We are committed to ensuring that there is no modern slavery or human trafficking in our supply chains or in any part of our business. Our Anti-slavery Policy reflects our commitment to acting ethically and with integrity in all our business relationships and to implementing and enforcing effective systems and controls to ensure slavery and human trafficking is not taking place anywhere in our supply chains.
RingCentral’s Commitment to Ethical Conduct
Our business is underpinned by the internal policies that are communicated to every individual working for RingCentral, including employees, agents and contractors. RingCentral is committed to ensuring that its employees comply with the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics ensures that our employees, directors, officers, agents and contractors are held to the highest standards of conduct. It sets out what we stand for and is designed to deter wrongdoing and promote honest and ethical conduct. It defines our obligation when selecting suppliers to ensure that we do not establish a business relationship with any supplier whose business practices violate applicable laws. All employees are required to take annual mandatory Code of Conduct trainings and adhere to the standards set forth therein.
Due diligence processes for slavery and human trafficking
As part of our initiative to identify and mitigate risk, in the UK our HR processes ensure that those recruited have appropriate approvals to work. Where we seek temporary labour, this is sourced via companies that are subject to their own obligations under the Modern Slavery Act. Where RingCentral operates outside the UK, we comply with local laws and regulations and apply the same standards as we do in the UK.
We have zero tolerance to slavery and human trafficking. To ensure all those in our supply chain and contractors comply with our values we have in place a RingCentral Vendor Code of Conduct that Vendors must adhere to in certain locations which sets out an obligation to provide safe working conditions and to treat workers with dignity and respect as well as to act fairly and ethically.
We have a dedicated compliance manager to whom employees can report concerns if they believe or suspect breaches of our Anti-Slavery Policy or have concerns that the treatment of workers or working conditions within our supply chains may constitute any form of Modern Slavery as well as a whistle-blower policy to protect those employees.
Training
To ensure a high level of understanding of the risks of modern slavery and human trafficking in our supply chains and our business, we provide training to our staff. We also require our Vendors
 
 to self-monitor and demonstrate compliance. RingCentral may also audit its vendors/suppliers to ensure compliance with the RingCentral Vendor Code of Conduct.
Further steps
Following a review of the effectiveness of the steps we have taken to ensure that there is no slavery or human trafficking in our own operations or in our supply chains, we are further developing systems and will continue to enhance the systems we now have in place to help us to:
 Identify and assess potential risk areas in our supply chains.
 Mitigate the risk of slavery and human trafficking occurring in our supply chains.
 Monitor potential risk areas in our supply chains.
 Protect whistle blowers.
 Ensure supplier adherence to our values.
We will report further on progress in our next statement.
We are pleased to publish our statement on our activities regarding the prevention of slavery and human trafficking in our business and supply chains globally. This statement has been formally approved by the Board of Directors of RingCentral, Inc.
For and on behalf of RingCentral Inc and its subsidiaries.
